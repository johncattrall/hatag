# export-findmy

Export AirTag/FindMy accessory private keys from iCloud, producing `.plist` files compatible with [FindMy.py](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py).

Should works on any platform? --- Tested on MacOS 26

## Prerequisites

- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
- `openssl` CLI (for building — generates dummy FairPlay certs needed by rustpush)
- `protoc` (protobuf compiler) — `brew install protobuf` on macOS

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisiscam/export-findmy.git
cd export-findmy
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

```bash
./target/release/export-findmy \
  --apple-id you@example.com \
  --output-dir ./keys
```

The tool will prompt for:
1. **Password** (hidden input)
2. **2FA code** — enter the **SMS code** sent to your phone, not the code shown on other devices
3. **Device passcode** — the screen lock passcode (iPhone PIN) or login password (Mac) of the device listed

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--apple-id <email>` | Apple ID email | prompted if omitted |
| `--anisette-url <url>` | Anisette v3 server URL | `https://ani.sidestore.io` |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | Where to write plist files | `.` |

### Example

```
$ ./target/release/export-findmy --apple-id xxxx@xxx --output-dir ./keys
Password:
[1/7] Connecting to anisette server...
[2/7] Logging in to Apple ID...
2FA code: 123456
  Logged in (dsid=......)
[3/7] Fetching MobileMe delegate...
[4/7] Setting up CloudKit & Keychain...
[5/7] Joining iCloud Keychain trust circle...
  Found 1 escrow bottle(s):
    [0] ......
  Using escrow bottle from device: L2MPKH342P
  Enter the passcode of that device:
  Joined keychain trust circle!
[6/7] Fetching FindMy accessories from CloudKit...
[7/7] Writing plist files...
  🎧 Wilbur's AirTag (AirTag) -> ./keys/Wilbur_s_AirTag.plist

Done! Exported 1 accessory plist file(s) to ./keys
```

## Output format

Each accessory produces a `.plist` file containing:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `privateKey` | EC private key (for deriving rolling BLE keys) |
| `sharedSecret` | Primary shared secret |
| `secondarySharedSecret` | Secondary shared secret (if present) |
| `publicKey` | EC public key |
| `identifier` | Stable accessory identifier |
| `name` | User-assigned name |
| `emoji` | User-assigned emoji |
| `model` | Hardware model |
| `pairingDate` | When the accessory was paired |
| `lastIndexObservationDate` | CloudKit rolling-key observation date, when available |
| `lastIndexObserved` | Rolling-key index at the observation date |

Filenames use the sanitized accessory name followed by the SHA-256 of its full
CloudKit record ID, preventing duplicate names from overwriting each other.
The name prefix is bounded to 120 UTF-8 bytes. The internal stable identifier
and private key material are unchanged. Name and alignment records reference the
CloudKit record ID, not the stable identifier.

Consumers must normalize raw key fields and dates as required by their FindMy.py
version. Preserve both alignment fields during conversion; when no CloudKit
observation exists, do not invent an alignment date or index.

## Security notes

- **Output plist files contain private key material.** Treat them like passwords.
- Your Apple ID password and device passcode are never written to disk.
- `anisette_state/` and `keystore.plist` are created in the working directory at runtime — these contain device provisioning state and keychain crypto keys. Delete them after use if you don't plan to run the tool again.
- The anisette server only sees OTP header requests from your IP. It never sees your Apple ID, password, or iCloud data.

## How it works

1. Authenticates to Apple via SRP (using remote anisette for device identity tokens)
2. Fetches MobileMe delegate tokens via the iOS `iosbuddy` login endpoint
3. Joins the iCloud Keychain trust circle via escrow recovery (using your device passcode)
4. Fetches encrypted `BeaconStore` records from CloudKit
5. Decrypts records using PCS (Protected CloudStorage) keys from the keychain
6. Writes accessory data to plist files
